                These climbing, evergreen perennials can reach up to 60 feet or more in height in their natural habitat.
                In your home, they can reach about eight feet in height. Their leaves alone can measure up to 2 feet
                long. Due to the impressive height of the monstera deliciosa, use a trellis or moist moss-covered sticks
                for support.
                </p>
               <p> 
                A monstera’s uniquely shaped leaves allow it to withstand downpours in tropical rain forests. Its
                structure also helps it take in the few streaks of sunlight that make it to the rain forest floor. These
                characteristics are how it gained another nickname: the hurricane plant.
               </p>
               <p> 
                These vibrant houseplants look best in living and dining rooms where your guests can admire them for all
                their beauty. Keep in mind, these plants take up a lot of space. So just be sure there’s extra room
                wherever you’re planning on showing your new greenery off. As an added bonus, they also purify the air!

                <p>
                    The right amount of sunlight is essential for a monstera’s leaf development. Place it in a spot 
                    where it can receive filtered, indirect sunlight. Too much direct sunlight can give a monstera yellow
                    or scorched leaves. You may need to rotate your plant if you notice its leaves reaching for sunlight,
                    so just be sure to keep an eye on it.

                <p>
                    Outdoors, monstera prefers a soil rich in organic material. It is tolerant of a variety of soil 
                    types, growing in loamy, sandy, clay, acidic or slightly alkaline soils. The site should have good 
                    drainage. For container plants indoors, use a peat-based, well-draining potting mix. Supply a moss 
                    stick for the plant to climb on. Attach sphagnum moss around a wooden slat by wrapping it in place 
                    with nylon thread and then insert it behind the plant into the soil in its container. Use containers
                    with drainage holes. In the landscape, provide monstera with a trellis if desired. Don't allow it
                    to climb into living trees.
                </p>

                    Water
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When actively growing, either outdoors or as a houseplant, keep the soil evenly moist.
                    During fall and winter, allow the soil to partially dry between waterings. Water container plants 
                    thoroughly until water comes out the drainage holes. Use rain water or demineralized water. When 
                    humidity becomes low in indoor locations, mist monstera occasionally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The monstera plant prefer normal room temperatures between 68–86 °F. Since it originally comes
                    from tropical rain forests, a similar tropical and humid atmosphere will make this plant feel
                    right at home. Misting your monstera deliciosa once a week can increase humidity around the plant
                    if you live in a dry area.
                </p>

                    Fertilizer
                </h3>
                <p>
                    During spring and summer when monstera is growing, fertilize plants monthly with a 
                    general purpose water-soluble fertilizer such as 20-20-20 applied at the rate of 1 
                    tablespoon per 1 gallon of water for outdoor plants and 1/2 teaspoon of water per 2 
                    quarts of water for indoor plants. Don't fertilize plants during winter. Keep the plants
                    to size by removing the ends of stems or branches, cutting back the growth to just above 
                    a leaf. Although you can prune monstera anytime, if you intend to root the cut-off pieces,
                    prune the plants in summer. Clean the pruners with a cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol
                     before you begin work. Prune off the upper aerial roots -- the bare, brown roots appearing
                    on stems -- if you wish. Allow lower aerial roots to grow into the soil or onto the moss stick
                    to help support the plant.

               <p> 
                Different monstera deliciosa varieties feature different leaves and sizes. You’ll
                notice subtle color variation and slightly different leaf structures in each plant.
                Take a look at a couple of the types you can have in your home:
               </p>
               <ul>
                   <li><i>M. deliciosa borsigiana</i><br>
                    This variety is perfect for you if you lack floor space, but still want to have a
                    beautiful monstera in your home. They typically grow quickly and are smaller in size 
                    compared to other varieties.
                   </li>
                   <li><i>M. deliciosa variegata</i><br>
                    This type of monstera deliciosa has yellowish-cream pattern dappled on its leaves.
                    This variation takes a long time to grow and is not as common to find in homes.
                    </li>
                   <li><i>M. deliciosa albovariegata</i><br>
                    The distinct white variegation on its leaves differentiates it from other monstera 
                    deliciosa varieties. No two leaves are ever alike! Some leaves become completely white
                    while others may feature speckled patterns. This is another rare monstera variety, 
                    similar to the M. deliciosa variegata.
                   </li>
               </ul>
            </div>

                    All parts of this plant, excluding its ripe fruit, are poisonous to humans and pets
                     making the larger variety not an ideal choice for pet owners. Opt for a mini variety
                    like the M. deliciosa borsigiana that you can keep high on shelves to prevent your 
                    curious furry friends from taking a bite. The plant can cause stomach pains if 
                    ingested and skin irritation if touched because of the calcium oxalates found in its
                    sap. It’s still safe to have in your home, as long you do not ingest any part of the
                    plant and take extra care when handling it. Take a look at our guide to poisonous plants 
                    to learn more about what to do if part of a monstera is ingested.
